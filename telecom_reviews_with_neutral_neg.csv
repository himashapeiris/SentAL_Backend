Dialog are best avoided. We use them for broadband (City Fibre). When the contract was taken out it took countless phone calls and two months without internet to get it installed and setup.

Some days later (after we had received the Dialog modem), they contacted us to say that there were no connections available in our area and so they couldn't supply the service. We had given our address, they'd accepted the contract and two weeks later we're faced with starting all over again with another firm thus delaying access to broadband even further. Incompetent hardly describes their service. Surely they should know what they can supply? Did Openreach really mess up, or did Dialog suddenly realise they couldn't fulfill their agreement with us and try to buy more space on the local cabinet?

One week before installation the contacted to say that Openreach has messed up their connection and we would have to wait an additional week. Some days later (after we had received the Dialog modem), they contacted us to say that there were no connections available in our area and so they couldn't supply the service. We had given our address, they'd accepted the contract and two weeks later we're faced with starting all over again with another firm thus delaying access to broadband even further. Incompetent hardly describes their service. Surely they should know what they can supply? Did Openreach really mess up, or did Dialog suddenly realise they couldn't fulfill their agreement with us and try to buy more space on the local cabinet? Several years ago I had issues with setting up my mobile phone contract with Dialog and it appears that they've not improved at all despite their assurances. AVOID!!!",negative
Dialog are best avoided. We use them for broadband (City Fibre). When the contract was taken out it took countless phone calls and two months without internet to get it installed and setup. Now we’re moving. We gave them over three weeks notice and we’re assure that all was good and we’d be transferred and set up on the day of the move. Five days prior to the move my wife called to confirm and they hadn’t a clue. Five hours of phone calls to five different Dialog people and we still have no broadband. The are totally incompetent. The worst customer service you’ll ever receive!,negative

"I called Dialog to say my broadband was not working. After stating the problem, their initial automated response was to tell me the best way to get it resolved was to go online. How was I supposed to do that when my broadband was not working? I held on the phone and it did say they would transfer me to a call handler. I then listened to a loud buzzing for 5 minutes before giving up. I will try again when I have more time.",negative

I lost my phone number. 3) I have a pay as you go line I use for travelling and every time I try to top it up I have issues and end up being charged twice but the credit is only applied once.",negative

I never thought I'd experience the day when I actually miss BT's customer service. Anyway I guess I'm heading to the ombudsman to try and get some sort of half decent service.",negative

"I've been a Dialog user for years, on pay as you go. However, recently having not used my phone for a few months, but it still being charged and with sim in place, I went to use it, and Dialog has made my number obsolete, so I have no way of using the phone to make phones calls, and the credit I had on the sim gone. How can they have the right to do this, that's theft? Dialog was always been more expensive than most of the other networks, but I never had problems with connectivity, which is why I stuck with them, however, now this has happened it severely reduces the number of stars I would have given them. You'll have seamless service right up until the day comes, when they make your number obselete and take your credit.",negative
I've made an payment 30 December to my dialog home broadband. I was charged and they claims my money never received to them.
