"I was anxious at first to get my iPhone 12 Pro set up. Brian and the other employees were kind, knowledgeable and eager to please. Thank you AT&T Boylston St. for helping, teaching, and assisting me. Highly recommend that store!
",positive
"his service is very reliable though I am disappointed that the max download speed averages 10.8 Mbps in my area. I would love to see the 25 Mbps they advertise for Baxley. No one I know has ever seen that. In rural America we have very limited choices, so I suppose I should be grateful that we have an advertised 12 Mbps plan from AT&T.",positive
"wow I cannot believe people dislike this internet. I have ATT fiber only @ 100 Mbps for $50 a month. They over-deliver on speeds, and I am often downloading at 150 Mbps or higher. I am extremely satisfied, although I will say the cable modem it comes with has a weak wifi signal in my 516 square foot studio. That is one thing they can improve upon ..",positive
I use the internet along with my Roku TV and 2 smartphones. My service is great and streaming is very good.,positive
"Switched to AT&T fiber so much better. When att fiber was available, I ordered and never been happier. I got Gig speeds for $80/mo. The gateway provided from AT&T was adequate for home user, but I use my own security gateway and access points. The provided gateway of bgw210 would get wifi speeds of 300-400 range and 900 on ethernet. My 3rd party access point would get wifi speeds in the 300-500 range, probably more if I had something that can handle the faster wifi.",positive
"The service was outstanding. I called on Sunday and they put me on a schedule for Wednesday. The technician came on time with all protective gear: mask, shoe cover. He was very professional, promptly explained everything that I did not have a question to ask. We have our hi-speed internet in 1 hour. This is great teamwork. Thank you and your customer service team.",positive
"Broadband is probably the best internet, tv, mobile, DSL, provider around. At least that's been the case till now, they need to get the fiber optic internet up and running all over the states by now",positive
AT&T Fiber's Internet 1000 is blazing fast and very reliable! I constantly see 900+mbps. Can't recommend them enough.,positive
AT&T Fiber has never gone down or slowed down since the day of installation. Extremely happy customer!,positive
The service has been reliably fast and smooth.,positive
"Internet has been quite reliable, and it's easy to contact customer service via a chat portal.",positive
"I have no complaints, We have had good service for quite a while now. The price is right!",positive
"Our AT&T gateway does the wireless and on the other side of the house, my Nexus 6P phone can do 125Mbps - checking against speedtest.net (ookla). That is a vast improvement over my old service connection.",positive
"Love the service, I have their 75 Mbps line. The only gripe I have is cost. I'm paying the same for 75 Mbps with ATT that I paid with another company for 250 Mbps at my old residence.",positive
Just got AT&T Fiber to my home and have U-verse and Internet over 100% Fiber. I had another provider for the past 10 years and always had problems. The U-verse picture is better than I had with my previous provider and the Internet is really fast. I have the 1000 Mbps internet and speeds run between 600-900 Mbps in each direction depending on test node.,positive
I love how reliable the internet services are,positive
"Service has never gone out, even during bad storms or hurricanes. DSL speed is very fast.",positive
"Special Deal 300 Mbps up/down (Gigabit for more money) Free install, equipment.... works great, no problems.",positive
AT&T is a great service provider and awesome customer service. They just need to work on moving fiber optics in outer areas and faster DSL service.,positive
The service is reliable and decent relative to the area. It can handle Netflix and a steam download at once. I am happy with the service,positive
" rarely have any issues. When I do, it is taken care of very quickly.",positive
"AT&T‘s fiber internet provides excellent and reliable speed (as long as your neighbor doesn’t accidentally mow over the fiber line before it’s buried, lol). Their service has not been affected by any kind of weather (storms, wind, rain, cold temperatures, etc.). We have several children that have been attending school remotely and have not overloaded the service yet. Another benefit of having AT&T internet is complimentary HBO Max—a fantastic perk that really adds value and entertainment to the mix.",positive
"AT&T Internet, for the most part, is quite reliable and rarely gives any problems with connectivity or billing. They don't put pressure on subscribers or run ad blitzes. On the rare occasions when problems have occurred the repair techs were on site in a reasonable amount of time. AT&T's traditional land line phone service is also very dependable. I'll stay connected as long as the service is still offered.",positive
"I have been with AT&T since I had a telephone in my car... that was 1993. I have great service and a reasonable rate and a 10% discount for working with the State of MD. It is a provider who goes above and beyond to provide the best service! Thank you, AT&T.",positive
AT&T TV and internet is amazing. I have been using this internet service for about 9 months now and have not had a bit of trouble. I love it. When they came and hook it all up they explained everything to me and showed me how to use their equipment.,positive
AT&T has provided good service - prompt and competent. Great contrast to our previous provider,positive
I have always had good service and problems solved easily. If there was ever a problem they handled very well. I go to the local AT&T store and they have handled everything I needed.,positive
Internet speed is very constant and almost without fluctuations like other providers. Price is a little bit high but is compensated by reliability which is the most important thing.,positive
AT&T service has gotten much better over the years. Customer service is excellent. Call back and follow thru is superb. Installation is spot on as well.,positive
"The reliability of AT&T has been great, their customer service is stellar, their technical staff courteous and knowledgeable. The speed is totally dependent on what you choose and what you’re willing to pay. Updates, new products and services are offered often.",positive
"I have AT&T for landline, telephone and internet. My experience with AT&T, including online, telephone and with technicians who come to my home, has always been great. AT&T personnel are knowledgeable and courteous.",positive
"I am using AT&T now and we are very happy with the company. Have had no big problems as of yet. Installation was very simple, with no satellite disk to install. Do recommend this company.",positive
"AT&T has provided excellent internet service. We are rarely down and in the past two to three years, have probably had to call them once to find out when service would be restored.",positive
"This internet service is very good, fast to navigate and for everything, I recommend it totally to everybody. It is the best provider.",positive
"Nearly 10 years with AT&T and never had a problem. I see the ads from all the others then think 'don't fix it if it isn't broken'. I will tell you the same thing, if you are happy with your cell provider stick with them.",positive
"The AT&T's services & staff were great with their internet & cable viewing. Plus, AT&T repair people had installed the cable. Pictures were awesome with a clear picture viewing.",positive
"AT&T U-verse offers good reliability and speed, no disconnections, install waiting time a little too long, customer service provides enough information.",positive
"My internet is really fast and because I already have phone service with AT&T, my internet bill is really cheap and my service has been way better than I expected.",positive
I find this internet provider to be the fastest and most service worthy from any others I've tried. Tried DSL and cable prior to this provider and was very disappointed. Thanks ATT for the fiber speed and awesome service when needed.,positive
Their customer service is excellent. They have always resolved my issues. I think if a person is getting the top package it should include new add on. Their service techs are competent and reliable.,positive
The internet hardly go out and it works well when it's storming or wind day. In winter it works and is great to have for internet choice in my opinion.,positive
I really like my AT&T U-verse internet. I have had it for over a week with no speed or service issues. The installer gave me his number and said if I ever have issues to call him and not tech support. Customer service needs work and the initial rep who set me up misled me on after promo pricing but its okay. I have no complaints. My wired connection runs at 43Mbps and wireless at 34Mbps. Great service. Glad to be rid of Mediacom and their slow 15Mbps service that never ran higher than 10Mbps at any time.,positive
"I have been an AT&T Uverse customer for 5 years and contrary to the reviews on here, I have not had any issues. In fact, I just moved my services to my new address and the tech Phillip was awesome! He got the services installed quickly as I moved in boxes. He gave me a wireless receiver for free. There was no charge to move services.",positive
