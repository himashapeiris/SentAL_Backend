dialoglk Nope I don't see any... even if I click on a direct link it just goes to my feed and nothing plays. I'm fedup of this.,negative

"What the hell @dialoglk 

4th time in this month router internet is not working 

I am continuously facing this problem 

What‰Ûªs happening there???

Don‰Ûªt you have a permanent solution for this problem???
I never heard that @SriLankaTelecom make any issues like you",negative
"@dialoglk Moreover, your technical team mentioned that the Indian signal interference issue is currently affected only to @dialoglk broadband signal and not for the mobile data signal.",negative
I finally choosed Dialog since two weeks and am plenty satisfied with the speed and the service.I was able to use the net the day of opening without any problem after three hours.Hope it will last.,positive
@dialoglk @KumarSanga2 Happy birthday Ranga ! All the best for today‰Ûªs game !,negative
"Really great service, came on-stream promptly, was knowledgeable (and eloquent). I was comparing you guys to another provider and this sealed the deal (along with sorting a Silver number when they werenÕt available Ð which showed some staff empowerment to get it, which bodes well). Anyway, IÕm signed up now so fingers crossed for the next stages",positive
Superb speed.,positive
This is place where they rip off from poor people. Horrible customer care service. They do not deserve to be the number 01.,negative
the credit loan is very reliable ,positive
High speed internet connection made my day.,positive
The router is superb along with the app allowing you to control and prioritise your broadband to devices.,positive
1st class service provider in Sri Lanka,positive
RT @MBManJuLa: How long does it usually take @dialoglk to say where the issue is?. Roughly around 48 minute if you call the super customer care. ,negative
"FUCKING TRICKED ME, BAD BUSINESS ITS A FUCKING JOKE. BULLSHIT BUSINESS STRUCTURE",negative
"Ever since I got Dialog broadband it would regularly drop out, Dialog's response has been to blame everyone but themselves, and have basically washed their hands of the problem stating I have too many internet enabled devices, despite their competitors (like BT) having no issues with the number of devices, and ignoring that their router does not actively manage these devices. I never thought I'd experience the day when I actually miss BT's customer service. Anyway I guess I'm heading to the ombudsman to try and get some sort of half decent service.",negative
MobitelSriLanka @dialoglk @AirtelSrilanka This is high time to open your generous to the Citizens of Sri Lanka. Data limits you all offer now doesn't serve the present requirements of your clients.Pls increase Data Limits ???????? https://t.co/CpPYFIDEB7,negative
"Effective download speed is around 9MB/sec = 72Mbit. Couldn't be happier given that is the current maximum for this type of line. Also the router is quite decent, has good coverage and a lot of configurable options in the web interface.",positive
@shashikaLB @Mahishini @dialoglk Exactly. This is also happening coz only two or three players dominate the broadband industry and hence Dialogention to individual customer is very low. And also @dialoglk doesn't know what customer care is and they should learn it from companies like @amazon,negative
I bought an i phone 7 plus last week. after few days i am experiencing some issues. people cannot hear what I say and there is a disturbance. today I experienced this for the second day. I was ask to visit the technical center with the warranty card. waste of money,negative
thank you for the support that you are giving for students to continue there work during this challenging time,positive
"Broadband or not as the case is! Very poor customer support. I have had an issue since 3rd March. I have rung, I have text, I have had several live chats, and no one listens, they just push you from one person to another or one department to another.",negative
" @Airtel @hnbplc Keep different subset of your data in different locations, services or providers. There, you can enjoy the services and still has some control over how much who knows about you In my case, my digital life is fragmented into about 17 different providers.",negative
@dialoglk do you want me to share the call recorder of my call to how I try to find the way to connect to a customer service and failed? ?Ùªã,negative
@Buddhikamn @Mahishini @dialoglk I think @dialoglk really needs to look at its practices and services - this is a far too common problem. It‰Ûªs so debilitating. I feel like their approach so far has been to ignore or offer the same solutions till we give up or the issue temporarily goes away.,negative
the packages are fair with the the amounts,positive
very happy with the service,positive
