dialoglk Nope I don't see any... even if I click on a direct link it just goes to my feed and nothing plays. I'm fedup of this.
"3 most useless things

1. Semi luxury buses
2. Neighbors love
3. @dialoglk"
I had a good VR gamimg experience with dialog
dialog is an exellent company
"What the hell @dialoglk 

4th time in this month router internet is not working 

I am continuously facing this problem 

Whatâ€™s happening there???

Donâ€™t you have a permanent solution for this problem???
I never heard that @SriLankaTelecom make any issues like you"
"@dialoglk Moreover, your technical team mentioned that the Indian signal interference issue is currently affected only to @dialoglk broadband signal and not for the mobile data signal."
I finally choosed Dialog since two weeks and am plenty satisfied with the speed and the service.I was able to use the net the day of opening without any problem after three hours.Hope it will last.
@dialoglk @KumarSanga2 Happy birthday Ranga ! All the best for todayâ€™s game !
"Really great service, came on-stream promptly, was knowledgeable (and eloquent). I was comparing you guys to another provider and this sealed the deal (along with sorting a Silver number when they weren’t available – which showed some staff empowerment to get it, which bodes well). Anyway, I’m signed up now so fingers crossed for the next stages"
Superb speed.
This is place where they rip off from poor people. Horrible customer care service. They do not deserve to be the number 01.
the credit loan is very reliable 
High speed internet connection made my day.
The router is superb along with the app allowing you to control and prioritise your broadband to devices.
1st class service provider in Sri Lanka
RT @MBManJuLa: How long does it usually take @dialoglk to say where the issue is?. Roughly around 48 minute if you call the super customer care. 
"FUCKING TRICKED ME, BAD BUSINESS ITS A FUCKING JOKE. BULLSHIT BUSINESS STRUCTURE"
"Ever since I got Dialog broadband it would regularly drop out, Dialog's response has been to blame everyone but themselves, and have basically washed their hands of the problem stating I have too many internet enabled devices, despite their competitors (like BT) having no issues with the number of devices, and ignoring that their router does not actively manage these devices. I never thought I'd experience the day when I actually miss BT's customer service. Anyway I guess I'm heading to the ombudsman to try and get some sort of half decent service."
MobitelSriLanka @dialoglk @AirtelSrilanka This is high time to open your generous to the Citizens of Sri Lanka. Data limits you all offer now doesn't serve the present requirements of your clients.Pls increase Data Limits ???????? https://t.co/CpPYFIDEB7
"Effective download speed is around 9MB/sec = 72Mbit. Couldn't be happier given that is the current maximum for this type of line. Also the router is quite decent, has good coverage and a lot of configurable options in the web interface."
@shashikaLB @Mahishini @dialoglk Exactly. This is also happening coz only two or three players dominate the broadband industry and hence Dialogention to individual customer is very low. And also @dialoglk doesn't know what customer care is and they should learn it from companies like @amazon
I bought an i phone 7 plus last week. after few days i am experiencing some issues. people cannot hear what I say and there is a disturbance. today I experienced this for the second day. I was ask to visit the technical center with the warranty card. waste of money
thank you for the support that you are giving for students to continue there work during this challenging time
"Broadband or not as the case is! Very poor customer support. I have had an issue since 3rd March. I have rung, I have text, I have had several live chats, and no one listens, they just push you from one person to another or one department to another."
"@ravinhwg @Huawei @dialoglk @Airtel @hnbplc Keep different subset of your data in different locations, services or providers. There, you can enjoy the services and still has some control over how much who knows about you.

In my case, my digital life is fragmented into about 17 different providers."
@dialoglk do you want me to share the call recorder of my call to how I try to find the way to connect to a customer service and failed? ?Ÿ™„
@Buddhikamn @Mahishini @dialoglk I think @dialoglk really needs to look at its practices and services - this is a far too common problem. Itâ€™s so debilitating. I feel like their approach so far has been to ignore or offer the same solutions till we give up or the issue temporarily goes away.
the packages are fair with the the amounts
very happy with the service
"I have never had an issue with coverage, which I have had with previous companies, living quite rural."
"After 18 months of promises to fix our broadband, which they claimed to be fibre and ran at download speeds of between 1 and 3 mbps, when our neighbours receive an average of 30, I managed to get the contract terminated. Switched to bt and, after a 20 minute visit from a technician, the problem was resolved, some 100 metres away from the house. Worst company I have ever taken a subscription with."
 network coverage is good and the unlimited max entertainment plan im on is excellent value also had a discount for being a loyal customer thumbs up from me
Your customer care officers have good technical knowledge about your services
Customer Service is first class.
@tikirimaarie @dialoglk Same. ?Ÿ˜??Ÿ˜? Mobile broadband though. Not home broadband..
@nisalatp @Huawei @dialoglk @Airtel @hnbplc Ahh yeah! Gotcha...
"The app is also brilliant! Being able to track what devices are connected is a god send, especially when I can boost the speed to one device when I am gaming!"
Dialog speed throttling internet
Shittiest 4G internet from @dialoglk at Dehiwala. Maybe its time to move on.
"Overcharge every month on mobile phone bill, even though told them multiple times to cap charges and block any excess usage."
@AnjulaHettige @dialoglk Hutch 3G is faster than Dialog 4G at my place
Possible throttle
@NuchuBuchu @NewsWireLK @dialoglk Kindly DM us your connection number and a reachable contact number to check and assist you. ^Raaq
@dialoglk horrible horrible mobile data! But your charges for mobile data are just superb ?Ÿ™„?Ÿ™„?Ÿ™„?Ÿ™„
"How @dialoglk responded to my complaint. Btw when I initially called customer service, they didn't want to give me a complaint reference number!! I had to force their supervisor to lodge the complaint in their system and give me the number!!! #ShitCustomerService https://t.co/KcbYIhKrRX"
Actually dialog services are very easy to use and superior customer service.
signal transmission for country side and rural areas are better 
@dialoglk Ok. Thank you for your possible reply ?Ÿ˜ç?Ÿ˜ç
DudePointless @dialoglk Government should take actions on these thieves
@dialoglk Straight up why you so slow?
great service dialog
The worst internet speed I've experienced through @dialoglk https://t.co/8jq0xfFtZ9
high network coverage even for remote areas of the contry 
"Nothing ever goes right with them. 1) I signed up for their 5g mobile broadband, got into a contract was sent a 5g modem/ router and them I found out there that there isn't any 5g coverage on the registered address. 2)I asked to port a phone number to their network as a new contract and they ended up replacing the number I already had with them. I lost my phone number. 3) I have a pay as you go line I use for travelling and every time I try to top it up I have issues and end up being charged twice but the credit is only applied once."
"Thanks for that awesomely fast, efficient and accurate service, my local number has been set up and configured within 10 minutes, I can hardly believe it. Great work."
dialog signal is very wide 
So slow. #internet by @dialoglk in colombo suburbs (Lets say #BDialogaramulla)
"@dialoglk i have raised a complain on 5th March, related to signal (slow ness) now i have barely internet. Mobile signal also seems to be week. No 4G. Firsy fix this ASAP. As this is yr failure, i want a wave off from my bill, ref is 2-0002734759"
@AnjulaHettige @dialoglk @TRCSL Number portability should be brought in soon
Dialog are best avoided. We use them for broadband (City Fibre). When the contract was taken out it took countless phone calls and two months without internet to get it installed and setup. Now we’re moving. We gave them over three weeks notice and we’re assure that all was good and we’d be transferred and set up on the day of the move. Five days prior to the move my wife called to confirm and they hadn’t a clue. Five hours of phone calls to five different Dialog people and we still have no broadband. The are totally incompetent. The worst customer service you’ll ever receive!
